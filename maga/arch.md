# Chapter 1: Introduction
 ## Background and Motivation
  ### Evolution of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)
   - history of tee
   - first versions of tee)
  ### The Role of TEEs in Modern Security Archoitectures
   - user data security
   - tee is everywhere
  ### Open-Source Hardware and RISC-V’s Emergence
   - growing riscv popularity
   - license freedom

 ## Problem Statement
  ### Gaps in RISC-V’s Security Ecosystem
   - riscv is young arch
   - security only start to evolve
  ### Lack of Standardized TEE Interfaces and Implementations for RISC-V
   - global platfrom
   - all tee are private
  ### Limitations of existing TEE implementations (e-g-, ARM TrustZone, Intel SGX)
   - all tee are private

 ## Relevance and Applications
  ### Addressing RISC-V’s growing adoption and security demands
  ### Secure firmware updates, cryptographic key management, digital rights management (DRM)
  ### Data Privacy in Open-Source Hardware
   - no backdors in hardware unlike in x86
  ### Modern security domains
   - Mobile
   - IoT
   - Automotive
   - Secure Cloud Services

   - SoK: Understanding the Prevailing Security Vulnerabilities in TrustZone-assisted TEE Systems
  ### Proprietary vs- Open-Source TEE Solutions
   - Alibaba Cloud Link (Alibaba Cloud, IoT Platform, IoT Edge Computing)
   - Apple Secure Enclave (all apple devices)
   - Huawei iTrustee (all Huawei devices)
   - Google Trusty (google pixel, chromebook)
   - Samsung TEEgris (all samsung devices, sell to automotive)
   - SiFive Secure OS
