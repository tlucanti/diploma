# Chapter 1: Introduction
 ## Background and Motivation
  ### Background on Trusted Execution Environments
   #### Introduction to Trusted Execution Environments
   - Modern device execution paradigms: Today’s devices — from smartphones to IoT and servers — often run more than one operating system concurrently on the same processor.
   - Parallel operating environments: Typically, there is a Normal Execution Environment where the main OS and applications run, and a separate Secure Execution Environment designed to protect sensitive code and data.
   - Purpose of this separation: Provides hardware-enforced isolation that allows sensitive computations (e.g., cryptography, DRM, payment processing) to occur securely without interference from normal system components or potential attackers.
   - the normal OS manages everyday tasks, but sensitive operations happen inside a protected environment.
   #### Evolution of Trusted Execution Environments
   - Brief history of TEEs in modern computing
   - dedicated secure coprocessors or special hardware modules (e.g., SmartCards, TPMs).
   - Comparison of different TEE implementations: typical architecture, communication methods, ecosystem maturity
   #### The Role of TEEs in Modern Security Archoitectures
   - Modern TEEs like ARM TrustZone and Intel SGX provide tightly integrated, hardware-enforced isolation within the main CPU, able to run complex trusted applications alongside a rich OS environment
   - modern TEEs support a wide range of complex applications beyond simple cryptographic tasks, including secure UI, attestation, and trusted computing on the cloud and edge
   - but regardless such popularity, there is still demand for transparent, open-source TEEs to overcome vendor lock-in and improve security audits
   - Growing needs to support more heterogeneous and multi-core environments
  ### The RISC-V Opportunity: Openness and Extensibility
   #### Open-Source Hardware and RISC-V’s Emergence
   - the majority of architectures are closed and has proprietary ISAs and implications
   - How openness promotes collaborative development, transparency, and trust
   - Growing industry adoption and ecosystem maturity
   #### The RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
   - Modular and extensible ISA design
   - scalable
   - free
   - RISC
   - opensource
   #### Advantages of an Open Architecture for Security
   - Reduced risk of hidden backdoors or proprietary vulnerabilities
   - Community-driven security audits and improvements
   - Facilitates experimentation with custom security extensions

 ## Problem Statement
  ### Current State of TEEs on Proprietary Architectures
   #### Limitations of existing TEEs on Proprietary Architectures
   - Vendor Lock-in and Dependency
   - Closed and Proprietary Ecosystems
   #### Technical and Operational Challenges
   - Hardware Complexity and Rigidity
   - Fixed ISA with no scope for tailoring or extension
   #### Licensing in Proprietary Architectures
   - Economic Impact of Proprietary Licensing
   - Licensing fees increase development and production costs
   - Licensing terms can limit usage scenarios or product variants
   - Uncertainty and Risks Due to Licensing Models

   - Potential legal and compliance risk for long-term projects dependent on vendor licenses
  ### The Emerging Need for Open and Flexible Solutions
   #### Current Status of RISC-V’s Security Ecosystem
   - Immaturity of RISC-V Security Extensions
   - Security extensions like World Guard are recent and still evolving
   - Fragmented and Limited Software Support
   - Lack of mature, standardized Secure OS implementations and TEE management tools
   - Early-stage experimental projects with limited stability and adoption
   #### Deficiency of Open TEE Standards and Interfaces for RISC-V
   - Unlike ARM which benefits from GlobalPlatform TEE APIs, RISC-V ecosystem lacks widely accepted open standard interfaces for secure OS and TA communication.
   - Current TEEs lack public source code or are tightly coupled to vendor hardware or platforms.
   - Difficult for external developers to adopt, audit, or extend.
   #### Motivation for an Open-Source Comprehensive Stack
   - Open Secure OS for RISC-V
   - To provide a minimal trusted computing base, flexible scheduling, and lifecycle management of trusted applications
   - Open Communication Drivers (Linux Integration)
   - Facilitates seamless and secure communication channels between normal and secure worlds
   - Open TEE Interface Specifications
   - Establish transparent, extensible, and standard communication protocols that can evolve with hardware capabilities
   #### Ecosystem Benefits
   - Democratizes secure computing capabilities on RISC-V platforms
   - Encourages research, community-driven security audits, and faster innovation cycles
   - Lowers costs and removes vendor lock-in risks, favoring adoption in academia, startups, and industry alike

 ## Relevance and Applications
  ### Rapid Growth of RISC-V in Commercial and Industrial Domains
   #### Wide Deployment Across Diverse Product Areas
   - -V has seen accelerating adoption in real-world commercial products, including
   - Industrial control and factory automation systems
   - On-premise and edge cloud computing platforms
   - Networking equipment and embedded consumer electronics
   - Highlights that RISC-V is no longer just experimental or academic; it’s establishing a growing footprint
   #### Absence of Security-Integrated Products to Date
   - Despite broad usage, existing RISC-V products largely lack integrated security features or trusted execution environments
   - Contrasted with ARM and x86 ecosystems where security technologies (TrustZone, SGX, SEV) are deeply embedded in many products
   - This absence is partly due to RISC-V’s relative architectural youth and evolving security extensions
   #### Motivation to Develop Secure RISC-V Solutions
   - Strong market motivation: given how critical security is in analogous ARM/x86 use cases, similar secure RISC-V products will inevitably emerge
   - Early engagement is crucial to shape and lead this upcoming market
   - a very good opportunity to provide open-source secure OS and TEE stack harnessing RISC-V-specific features (e.g., World Guard).
  ### Expanding Security Requirements in Modern Computing
   #### Essential Security Functions in Contemporary Products
   - Security features like cryptographic key management, secure boot, and firmware integrity are baseline expectations today in mobile devices, automotive electronics, and cloud servers
  #### RISC-V’s Untapped Potential for Secure Applications
  - Opportunity for RISC-V to enter markets currently dominated by proprietary ISAs with an open and transparent security story
  - Potential applications demanding trustworthiness:
  - secure personal devices
  - automotive systems
  - confidential cloud workloads
  - IoT ecosystems
  - Open-source secure components can drastically lower barriers for adoption and innovation

 ## Comparison with Existing Architectures
  ### ARM TrustZone: Centralized Secure World Model
   #### Overview
   - Hardware-enforced split between Normal World and Secure World running on the same CPU cores
   - Secure World hosts a Secure OS managing Trusted Applications
   #### Advantages
   - Mature ecosystem with broad adoption (mobile, embedded)
   - Efficient context switching between secure and normal worlds
   - Well-supported industry standards (e.g., GlobalPlatform TEE)
   #### Disadvantages
   - Centralized model: single secure world may become a bottleneck
   - Limited scalability on multi-core systems (single Secure World across cores).
   - Security boundary depends strongly on software (Trusted OS) correctness.
  ### Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX): Enclave-Based Isolation
   #### Overview
   - Enclaves are isolated regions of memory with hardware enforced encryption and integrity protection
   - Applications selectively isolate sensitive code/data inside enclaves with fine granularity
   #### Advantages
   - Flexible on a per-application basis; multiple enclaves can co-exist
   - Strong memory encryption and attestation capabilities
   - Does not require a separate secure OS
   #### Disadvantages
   - Limited enclave size and complexity constraints
   - Complex programming model and compatibility issues
   - Vulnerabilities found in side-channels and speculative execution attacks
  ### AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV)
   #### Overview
   - Encrypts entire VM memory transparently to protect guest VMs from a compromised hypervisor
   - Targets cloud scenarios with multi-tenant isolation
   #### Advantages
   - Seamless protection for virtual machines with little change to guest OS.
   - Strong hardware encryption of memory with real-time decryption
   #### Disadvantages
   - Focused on virtualization; not suitable for all embedded or mobile scenarios
   - Trust anchored primarily on hypervisor and hardware
   - Limited granularity compared to enclave or secure world models
  ### RISC-V’s World Guard Extension: Decentralized Isolation
   #### Overview
   - Hardware extensions enabling memory and execution partitioning at finer granularity than TrustZone
   - Supports multiple isolated domains (“worlds”) potentially running in parallel on multi-core systems
   #### Advantages
   - Decentralized design enhances scalability and flexibility for multi-core/multi-tenant use cases
   - Open ISA allows community-driven security extensions and transparent implementation
   - Enables novel Secure OS designs with tailored isolation policies
   - WorldGuard has a superset of capabilities compared with TrustZone, so if only two worlds used - this will closely match TrustZone model and GlobalPlatform TEE API can be used with WorldGuard
   #### Disadvantages
   - Early Stage of Standardization and Development: lacking wide hardware and software support
   - Limited Ecosystem and Tooling Support: Unlike ARM TrustZone or Intel SGX, which have mature SDKs, secure OSes, middleware, and developer tools, World Guard currently lacks a rich ecosystem
   - Need for Accompanying Secure Software Stack: Hardware support alone is insufficient; a complete trusted execution environment requires well-designed Secure OS, runtime environments, drivers, and APIs — these are still under development or experimental for World Guard
   - Adoption and Interoperability Challenges: Fragmentation or vendor-specific variations could impede standardization and cross-platform TEE portability

# Chapter 2. Trusted Execution Environment Foundations
 ## TEE Overview
  ### Definition and Core Principles
   #### Trusted Execution Environment
   - descrption: secure area of a main processor ...
   - list core principles
   #### Isolation
   - separaion on Rich Environment and Trusted Environment
   #### Integrity
   - guarantees that the code and data within it are untampered
   #### Confidentiality
   - Data and code inside the TEE are kept confidential
   - No software outside the TEE can access data inside the TEE
   #### Secure Storage
   - storage of sensitive data even when powered off
   #### Attestation
   - integrity approval from remote server
   #### Trusted Execution
   - Only authorized and verified code can run within the TEE
   #### Minimal Trusted Computing Base (TCB)
   - minimizing ccomponents that must be trusted
   - root of trust

  ### Security Requirements and Design Goals
   #### Core Components
   -
   #### Isolated Execution Unit
   - dedicated CPU core
   - or isolated CPU state
   #### Normal World
   - where Rich Execution Environment runs
   #### Secure World
   - where Trusted Execution environment runs
   #### Trusted Applications
   - Applications running inside the TEE that perform sensitive tasks
   #### Secure Storage
   - data stored outside TEE and always encrypted
   - but keys can never leave TEE
   #### Memory Isolation
   - RAM is divided to Normal, Secure and Shared areas
   - Normal area can not be accesed by TEE
   - Secure area can not be accessed by REE
   - only shared area can be used to transfer data
   #### Cryptographic Engine
   - hardware or software module providing secure cryptographic functions
   #### Attestation Mechanism
   - hashes of TEE components signed with secure keys
   #### Secure APIs
   - Interfaces through which normal applications or the Rich Execution Environment can request services from the TEE

 ## Threat Model
  ### Normal World Assumptions
   #### untrasted OS
   - The Normal World is assumed to be fully untrusted
   - Normal World can be compromised by malware, user-level or kernel-level rootkits
   - No sensitive data can be placed in Normal World
   #### Hostile OS
   - The Normal World may attempt to attack the TEE by using privileged access
   - read or tamper with TEE memory
   - intercept or replay communication with the TEE
   - Launching DoS (Denial of Service) attacks against TEE services
   #### Limited Visibility
   - The TEE assumes that the Normal World cannot access TEE data
   #### Control over Non-secure resources
   - Normal World is responsible for forwarding requests between trusted applications in the TEE and external sources / user
   #### Schedule priorities
   - The Normal World may refuse to schedule or service TEE requests
   - so by desigh - not Normal world should call TEE, but TEE should check requests by itself
  ### Attack vectors
   #### Direct Memory Access Attacks
   - If DMA engines (e.g., from peripherals) are not properly restricted, they might access Secure World memory
   - Usage of IOMMU is crucial
   #### Side-Channel Attacks
   - Exploit indirect information leakage (timing, power, electromagnetic radiation, cache behavior)
   - like Meltdown, Spectre, Red Bleeding
   - Constant-time algorithms in the TEE, side-channel resistant hardware, noise introduction, cache partitioning or flushing techniques should be used
   #### Physical Attacs
   - Physical attacs Using power glitches, clock glitches, voltage variations, or electromagnetic interference to cause faults
   - Physical access combined with Normal World privileges could help mount attacks like probing or injecting malicious signals
   #### API Exploitation
   - Malicious Normal World software crafts malicious inputs or sequences of calls to the Secure World, causing buffer overflows, logic bugs, or privilege escalation within the Secure World
   - Strict input validation robust secure OS design should be used
   #### Man-in-the-Middle Attacks
   - The communication channel between Normal and Secure World is a major interface
   - Normal World manipulates, replays, or drops messages to confuse or exploit Secure World services
   - Use cryptographic nonce, session tokens, to validate integrity and freshness
   #### Denial of Service Attacs
   - Flooding Secure World with calls, starves it of resources, or blocks communication
   - Rate limiting, watchdog timers, graceful degradation
   #### Boot and Firmware Attacks
   - Compromise of bootloader or firmware update process can undermine Secure World trust (load malicious secure OS or patch trusted apps).
   - Secure boot, cryptographic verification of firmware and Secure World images should be used
