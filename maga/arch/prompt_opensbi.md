I am doing a project with 3 parts:
 1. Secure OS for RISC-V World Guard extension.
 2. Linux driver for communication with Secure OS.
 3. OpenSBI modification to support World Guard extension.

Secure OS is a monolith OS with capability based model, so the idea is that everething is a handle, all handles (that are listed at predefined Manifest) are given by root task to Trusted Application when it spawned. Creation of objects are done with fabric object handle. Every action to handle is checked with capability model and granted or denied.
Secure OS always works on first cpu core, other cores are left for Linux. Communication between Linux and Secure OS is provided using two shared pages. One page for requests (to secure OS) queue, second page for responses queue. It uses subset of Global Platform API as interface for communications.

I need to write Master's thesis abort part with Secure OS.
It should have 4 chapters:

# Chapter 1: Foundations and Motivation for an Open Secure OS on RISC-V
# Chapter 2. Core Principles of Trusted Execution Environment and Threat Model
# Chapter 3: Design and Implementation of the Secure Operating System
# Chapter 4: Evaluation and Security Analysis

So, 3th chapter is about Design and Implementation of the Secure Operating System
I have a draft of chapter 4:
