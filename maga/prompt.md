I am doing a project with 3 parts:
 1. Secure OS for RISC-V World Guard extension.
 2. Linux driver for communication with Secure OS.
 3. OpenSBI modification to support World Guard extension.

Secure OS is a monolith OS with capability based model, so the idea is that everething is a handle, all handles (that are listed at predefined Manifest) are given by root task to Trusted Application when it spawned. Creation of objects are done with fabric object handle. Every action to handle is checked with capability model and granted or denied.
Secure OS always works on first cpu core, other cores are left for Linux. Communication between Linux and Secure OS is provided using two shared pages. One page for requests (to secure OS) queue, second page for responses queue. It uses subset of Global Platform API as interface for communications.

I need to write Master's thesis abort part with Secure OS.
It should have 4 chapters:

# Chapter 1: Foundations and Motivation for an Open Secure OS on RISC-V
# Chapter 2. Core Principles of Trusted Execution Environment and Threat Model
# Chapter 3: Design and Implementation of the Secure Operating System
# Chapter 4: Evaluation and Security Analysis

So, 4th chapter is about Evaluation and Security Analysis
I have a draft of chapter 4:

# Chapter 4: Evaluation and Security Analysis
 ## Software Stack Setup
  ### Toolchains
  ### Emulation Environment
  ### Linux
  ### Build System
  ### CI Integration
 ## Demonstration of Secure OS Functionality
  ### Building the Software Stack
  ### Example Trusted Application: Simple Arithmetic TA
  ### Demonstration and Execution
 ## Security Analysis
  ### Review of Threat Model and Security Goals
  ### Resilience against Normal World Attacks
  ### Resilience against buggy TAs
  ### Potential Vulnerabilities and Limitations
 ## Performance Evaluation
  ### Latency of operations
  ### Communication Performance
 ## Conclusions
 ## Future Work
  ### Advanced TA Features
  ### Trusted User Interface Implementation
  ### Multicore Support for Secure World
  ### Formal Verification of Secure Components
  ### Dynamic TA Loading
  ### Porting to Real RISC-V Hardware with WorldGuard
  ### Hardenings against Attacks

Starting with 4.3 Security Analysis:
I have a draft of structure:

 ## Security Analysis
  ### Resilience against Normal World Attacks
   #### Unauthorized Access to Secure Memory
   #### Unauthorized Access to Secure OS/TA Code
   #### Attempts to Corrupt Shared Memory Queues
   #### Exploiting CWC Protocol
  ### Resilience against buggy TAs
   #### Inter-TA Isolation
   #### Capabilities
  ### Potential Vulnerabilities and Limitations
   #### Side-Channel Attacks
   #### Physical Attacks
   #### Complexity of TCB (Trusted Computing Base)

This section is about attempts to attack Secure OS, describes setups for attacks (how attack was performed) and real reaction of system to these attacks.

Create a plan of sub chapters with brief description
If needed - rename some sub chapters if there is more suitable naming, or maybe add some sub chapters or points if there is anything else to say to enhance the structure.
