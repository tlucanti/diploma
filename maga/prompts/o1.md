ADDITIONAL NOTES:
• You may include a formal section at the end for references and appendices (if you need to present listings of code, sample manifests, or extended test results).
• Feel free to add sections on performance evaluation under Demonstration and Security Analysis if you conduct benchmarks or other testing metrics.
• For a comprehensive paper, each subsection can include diagrams or flowcharts, especially in Chapters 2 and 3 (e.g., flow of the boot process, layout of shared memory, capability propagation model).

Use this structure as a flexible template, refining or reorganizing to suit your specific implementation details and the depth of the technical discussion you wish to provide.
