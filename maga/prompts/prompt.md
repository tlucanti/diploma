project background:
Secure OS is a microkernel OS with capability based model, so the idea is that everything is a handle, all handles (that are listed at predefined Manifest) are given by root task to Trusted Application when it spawned. Creation of objects are done with fabric object handle. Every action to handle is checked with capability model and granted or denied.
Secure OS always works on first cpu core, other cores are left for Linux. Communication between Linux and Secure OS is provided using two shared pages. One page for requests (to secure OS) queue, second page for responses queue. It uses subset of Global Platform API as interface for communications.

Paper should have 4 chapters:

# Chapter 1: Foundations and Motivation for an Open Secure OS on RISC-V
# Chapter 2: Core Principles of Trusted Execution Environment and Threat Model
# Chapter 3: Design and Implementation of the Secure Operating System
# Chapter 4: Evaluation and Security Analysis

So, 3rd chapter is about Design and Implementation of the Secure Operating System
I have a draft of chapter 3:

Starting with 3.2.3 Memory Layout and Addressing
I have a draft of thess sections:

#### Physical and Virtual Addressing
- Provides a high-level overview of how the Secure OS configures its page tables and manages physical/virtual addresses.
- Explains how memory mappings differ between the Secure World and the Normal World.
#### Isolation Mechanisms
- Details how World Guard extension enforces secure boundaries at the hardware level.
- Shows how the Secure and Normal Worlds remain isolated, preventing unauthorized access to protected pages.
#### Shared Memory Queues
- Explains the reserved memory regions that serve as shared buffers for secure–normal communication.
- Highlights concurrency concerns and locking strategies for ring-buffer manipulation.

write contents of sections based on draft.
If needed - maybe add some points if there is anything else to say by topic.
