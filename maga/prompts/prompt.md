project background:
Secure OS is a microkernel OS with capability based model, so the idea is that everything is a handle, all handles (that are listed at predefined Manifest) are given by root task to Trusted Application when it spawned. Creation of objects are done with fabric object handle. Every action to handle is checked with capability model and granted or denied.
Secure OS always works on first cpu core, other cores are left for Linux. Communication between Linux and Secure OS is provided using two shared pages. One page for requests (to secure OS) queue, second page for responses queue. It uses subset of Global Platform API as interface for communications.

Paper should have 4 chapters:

# Chapter 1: Foundations and Motivation for an Open Secure OS on RISC-V
# Chapter 2: Core Principles of Trusted Execution Environment and Threat Model
# Chapter 3: Design and Implementation of the Secure Operating System
# Chapter 4: Evaluation and Security Analysis

So, 3rd chapter is about Design and Implementation of the Secure Operating System
I have a draft of chapter 3:

Starting with chapter 3.4.1. Secure OS Early Initialization
I have a draft of chapter sections:

#### OpenSBI Handover
- Explanation of the OpenSBI boot protocol, which provides the Secure OS with the initial register context (e.g., a0, a1 containing specific parameters).
- SBI boots FW_PAYLOAD_PATH (TEEOS futher) on boot core, making this core secure
- High-level overview of how the Secure OS entry point (_start) is invoked by OpenSBI.
- Handling or storing system parameters (such as the device tree pointer) for further use.
#### Setting Up the Stack and Basic Memory Layout
- Allocating a stack in physical memory for secure execution.
- How the assembly code (head.S) calculates the stack location (via PAGE_SIZE * 6).
- Ensuring stack alignment for correct RISC-V operation.
#### First Kernel Relocation
- performing a “relocation” step due to pie (position-independent executable) nuances.
- Creating an identity mapping (physical == virtual) at the kernel load address while also mapping the kernel at its designated virtual base (KERNEL_VIRTUAL_BASE).
- Use of large page mappings (e.g., 2MB or 1GB mappings) for simplicity during early boot.
#### Enabling the MMU
- Explanation of how the SATP register is configured
- Ensuring the kernel text, data, and bss segments are accessible at both the physical region and the kernel virtual address.


write contents of these sections based on draft.
If needed - maybe add some points if there is anything else to say by topic.
full structure of whole paper and some of secure kernel boot code is in the attached file
Do not repeat yourself! Do not repeat points from other chapters! Keep it concise! Write only section contents, no summary or reasoning.
