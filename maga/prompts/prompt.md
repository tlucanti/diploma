project background:
Secure OS is a microkernel OS with capability based model, so the idea is that everything is a handle, all handles (that are listed at predefined Manifest) are given by root task to Trusted Application when it spawned. Creation of objects are done with fabric object handle. Every action to handle is checked with capability model and granted or denied.
Secure OS always works on first cpu core, other cores are left for Linux. Communication between Linux and Secure OS is provided using two shared pages. One page for requests (to secure OS) queue, second page for responses queue. It uses subset of Global Platform API as interface for communications.

Paper should have 4 chapters:

# Chapter 1: Foundations and Motivation for an Open Secure OS on RISC-V
# Chapter 2: Core Principles of Trusted Execution Environment and Threat Model
# Chapter 3: Design and Implementation of the Secure Operating System
# Chapter 4: Evaluation and Security Analysis

So, 3rd chapter is about Design and Implementation of the Secure Operating System
I have a draft of chapter 3:

# Chapter 3: Design and Implementation of the Secure Operating System

Starting with chapter 3.5.2. Shared Memory Queues
I have a draft of chapter sections:

#### Shared Memory Ring Buffers
- Overview of how the queues are physically placed in shared memory pages accessible to both SWd and NWd.
- Ring buffer layout: circular array of message slots, head/tail pointers
- Memory alignment considerations for preventing false sharing or alignment-related issues.
#### Requests Queue
- A dedicated ring buffer where the Normal World places requests that the Secure World must handle.
- Steps for enqueuing:
  1. Normal World driver writes the message into the ring slot.
  2. Driver updates the queue head pointer using an atomic operation.
  3. IPI sent (or polling mechanism invoked) to notify Secure World.
#### Responses Queue
- A separate ring buffer for the Secure World to provide responses or event notifications back to the Normal World.
- The Secure World writes its response into the ring slot, increments the tail pointer, and relies on NWd polling.
#### Canary Around Shared Pages
- Canary pages are placed around Shared pages with no access bits, so any access by overflowing will trap

write contents of these sections based on draft.
If needed - maybe add some points if there is anything else to say by topic.
full structure of whole paper and some of secure kernel boot code is in the attached file.
Do not repeat yourself! Do not repeat points from other chapters! Keep it concise! Write only section contents, no summary or reasoning.
